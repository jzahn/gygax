# Gygax

### Main Navigation
- Adventure
- Forge

## Two modes of use
1. Forge: DMs can create campaigns and model adventures then use them for hosting a session
2. Adventure: Players can create characters and use one of those caracters to join a gaming session being hosted by a DM.

## Forge - Build and host a campaigns and adventures

### Campaigns

A collection of adventures. It basically has the same UI for CRUD that campaigns do now. Like adventures (currently campaigns) they can have a name, a description and an image (with a selectable hotspot for display in the banner at the top of the campaign detail page). Campaign images will be landscape instead of portrait. I want the campaign detail to look more or less like the adventure detail page (currently the campaign detail page). It should have a graphic at the top banner style, with a title, a description and a list of adventure cards.

### Adventures

Currently what we term a campaign. We just need to refactor the name on this now campaign -> adventure. Eventually we are going to add more features to adventures than we have see below.

### Maps
- Hex
- Grid

### Backdrop

A backdrop is an image that a DM can elect to display for the characters while they are not looking at a map. They could use it to show a town while adventurers are in town, or to display a battle or monster scene while adventurers are fighting. The possibilities are endless.

### Create a Character or NPC

Similar to normal players DMs should be able to create characters. They can be used as NPCs

### Notes

DMs should be able to have entries of notes with a title.

## Adventure - join an adventure hosted by a DM

There should be a top level navigation item called Adventure. This is where players create characters and join games being hosted by a DM.

### Create a Character

Players should be able to create characters after coming to the Adventure section. They can create as many as they like. Characters should appear on a character sheet that looks like the one in the Moldavy B/X Rulebook.

### Browse and Join

Players should be able to browse and join games which are being hosted and are open to join. Once selecting a game they should be able to choose the character they want to play and join the gaming session.
